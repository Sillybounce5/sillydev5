Minecraft 1.20 Features, Release, & Stuff
Date

Minecarft 1.19 has released recently and now we’re onto 1.20, but when will that release? Minecraft last 5 major updates have released in the following order being June, November, June, June, and December. Following that pattern 1.20 should release around November or December. 
The name for 1.20 has not yet been announced  but some features to arrive have been heavily implied to come, such as Spectator mode for Bedrock along with a new UI, and a stop to mobs spawning in nether portals. 
Besides features that are most likely to come, there are other speculations as well. With 1.19 brining swamp features into the game from a past vote 1.20 could do the same. Possible biomes and mobs being the desert, the badlands, the savanna, vultures, ostriches, meerkats, and termites. 
Over the past few updates Bedrock and Java have become a lot more similar so expect features from one version to be brought over to the other like /locatebiome, custome shields, spectator mode, and hardcore mode. The developers have confirmed they have worked on /locatebiome, custome shields, and spectator mode so it’s likely for those to come sooner rather than later. 
1.19 just released so it’s still early to speculate but that also means the update could be about anything. Even kookaburras. Java’s 1.6 update is known as The Horse Update, so sure possible updates could be the End Update, the Combat Update, or even Caves & Cliffs Part 4! But with a name like that.. The Kookaburra Update is also a possibility.
